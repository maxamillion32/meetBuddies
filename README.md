# MeetBuddies
As part of its activities, a group of people should hold meetings . To facilitate the organization and management of these meetings they decided to use a Android App.
This is based on user preferences , its geographical position and its timetable for proposing schedules and types of meeting places. Each member of the group already manages his schedule with his mobile device ( phone or tablet ) that runs on Android.
